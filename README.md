Progressive Web App
-------------------

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) allows to create a user experience similar to native applications on mobile and desktop devices. They are installable on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser and can work offline.

### Install PWA on Android
Pop up banner will automatically suggest installation on first load of the page. Otherwise select option "Add to home screen" in your browser menu.

On Android, PWAs allows push notifications, background synchronization, among other native functionalities.

### Install PWA on iOS
To install PWA on iOS, open "share" menu and select "On home screen" option.

Apple is still not fully supporting PWA, because it allows developpers to get around the Apple Store, since iOS version 12.2 it slightly improved though.

### Install PWA on desktop
Open your browser options on the top right of the window. An option to install application will appear.
